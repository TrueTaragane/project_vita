make logs-follow

# View system metrics
make metrics

# Check service health
make health
```

### AI Model Management
```bash
# Download required models
make download-models

# Quantize models for efficiency
make quantize-models

# Update models to latest versions
make update-models

# Validate model integrity
make validate-models
```

## üîß Detailed Command Descriptions

### Setup Commands

#### `make setup`
Performs complete initial setup:
- Clones repository if needed
- Creates required directories
- Sets up environment variables
- Installs system dependencies

#### `make install`
Installs all required software dependencies:
- Docker and Docker Compose
- GPU drivers (if applicable)
- Python dependencies
- System utilities

#### `make update`
Updates the system to the latest version:
- Pulls latest code from repository
- Updates Docker images
- Applies database migrations
- Restarts services

### Service Management Commands

#### `make up`
Starts all services defined in docker-compose:
- Home Assistant
- Frigate
- Qwen3-Omni
- Whisper STT
- Piper TTS
- Monitoring stack

#### `make down`
Gracefully stops all services:
- Sends termination signals
- Waits for clean shutdown
- Preserves data volumes

#### `make restart`
Restarts all services:
- Stops all services
- Starts all services
- Useful for applying configuration changes

### Development Commands

#### `make build`
Builds all custom Docker images:
- Omni module image
- Custom Frigate configuration
- Home Assistant custom components

#### `make test`
Runs all test suites:
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Performance tests for AI models

### Maintenance Commands

#### `make backup`
Creates complete system backup:
- Database dumps
- Configuration files
- Model files (if space allows)
- Docker volume snapshots

#### `make restore`
Restores system from backup:
- Stops all services
- Restores data from backup file
- Starts services
- Validates restoration

### Monitoring Commands

#### `make logs`
Displays logs from all services:
- Combined log output
- Color-coded by service
- Timestamped entries

#### `make health`
Checks health of all services:
- Service status (running/stopped)
- Health check results
- Resource utilization
- Error counts

### AI Model Commands

#### `make download-models`
Downloads required AI models:
- Qwen3-Omni model
- Whisper STT model
- Piper TTS voices
- Computer vision models

#### `make quantize-models`
Quantizes models for efficiency:
- Converts models to lower precision
- Reduces memory requirements
- Maintains acceptable accuracy

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file to customize behavior:
```bash
# GPU configuration
GPU_DEVICE=0
GPU_MEMORY=24G

# Model paths
MODEL_QWEN3=/path/to/qwen3-model
MODEL_WHISPER=/path/to/whisper-model

# Service ports
PORT_HOME_ASSISTANT=8123
PORT_FRIGATE=5000
```

### Service Selection
Start only specific services:
```bash
# Start only core AI services
make up-core

# Start only monitoring services
make up-monitoring

# Start only computer vision services
make up-vision
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Docker Permission Errors
```bash
# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Restart Docker service
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

#### GPU Not Detected
```bash
# Check NVIDIA drivers
nvidia-smi

# Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit
make install-nvidia
```

#### Services Not Starting
```bash
# Check logs for specific service
make logs-service SERVICE=home-assistant

# Rebuild specific service
make build-service SERVICE=home-assistant
```

#### Insufficient Disk Space
```bash
# Clean unused Docker resources
make docker-clean

# Remove old backups
make clean-backups
```

## üìà Performance Tips
