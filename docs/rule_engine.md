# Rule Engine Specification

## üß† Overview

The Vita Rule Engine is a flexible automation system that allows users to create complex home automation scenarios using natural language, visual programming, or YAML configurations. It integrates with Home Assistant, MQTT brokers, and custom Vita services.

```

### Core Components

1. **Rule Parser**: Converts natural language or YAML rules into executable logic
2. **Condition Evaluator**: Monitors sensors, devices, and services for trigger conditions
3. **Action Executor**: Executes commands on devices and services
4. **Feedback Loop**: Monitors results and adjusts behavior based on outcomes

## üìê Rule Structure

### YAML Format
```yaml
rule:
  name: "Evening Lighting"
  description: "Automatically adjust lighting based on time and occupancy"
  trigger:
    - type: "time"
      value: "sunset"
    - type: "motion"
      device: "living_room_motion"
      state: "on"
  conditions:
    - type: "device_state"
      device: "living_room_lights"
      state: "off"
    - type: "time_window"
      start: "17:00"
      end: "23:00"
  actions:
    - type: "device_command"
      device: "living_room_lights"
      command: "set_brightness"
      value: 75
    - type: "notification"
      service: "telegram"
      message: "Evening lighting activated"
```

### Natural Language Format
```
WHEN sunset occurs AND motion is detected in living room
AND living room lights are off AND time is between 17:00-23:00
THEN set living room lights to 75% brightness
AND send telegram notification "Evening lighting activated"
```

## üîß Supported Triggers

### Time-based
- `sunrise` / `sunset`
- Specific times (`18:30`)
- Recurring schedules

### Device-based
- State changes (`on`/`off`)
- Sensor readings (temperature, humidity, motion)
- Custom device events

### AI-based
- Voice commands
- Computer vision events
- Predictive triggers

## üéØ Supported Conditions

### Logical Operators
- AND, OR, NOT
- Nested conditions
- Time windows

### Comparison Operators
- Equal, Not Equal
- Greater Than, Less Than
- Within Range

### State Checks
- Device states
- Service availability
- Network connectivity

## ‚ö° Supported Actions

### Device Control
- Power on/off
- Set values (brightness, temperature, volume)
- Custom device commands

### Notification
- Email alerts
- SMS notifications
- Telegram messages
- Voice announcements

### Service Integration
- API calls to external services
- Database operations
- File operations

## üß™ Testing Framework

### Unit Testing
```yaml
test:
  name: "Evening Lighting Test"
  setup:
    - set_device_state: "living_room_lights=off"
    - set_time: "18:30"
    - simulate_motion: "living_room_motion=on"
  expected:
    - device_state: "living_room_lights=brightness:75"
    - notification_sent: "telegram"
```

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end scenario validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Stress testing with multiple concurrent rules

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics

### Rule Performance
- Execution time
- Success/failure rates
- Resource utilization

### System Health
- Rule engine uptime
- Memory usage
- Processing queue depth

## üîí Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions for rule creation
- Audit logs for all rule changes
- Secure API endpoints

### Data Protection
- Encryption of sensitive rule data
- Secure storage of credentials
- Privacy-preserving event processing
